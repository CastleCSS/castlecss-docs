## CastleCSS Framework
Sourcecode for www.castlecss.com and the documentation for [CastleCSS](https://github.com/CastleCSS/castlecss)

## How to install
- Download or clone this package
- Build the project with: ```npm install``` + ```webpack``` + ```grunt```
- You can now see the project in dist folder, open a .html page in your browser

## Roadmap
We're currently working hard on making the CastleCSS expansions and improvements. CastleCSS is made to serve as lightweight basis for tailor made software but we do want to give you the option to install a few modules to make your life easier.

Please see the [ROADMAP.MD](https://github.com/CastleCSS/castlecss/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) for our current plans for the future.
